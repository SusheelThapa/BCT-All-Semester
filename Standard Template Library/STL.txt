Standard Template Library(STL)
As, its name suggest it is library of Template i.e generic classes and functions.


Why use STL?
->Reuse: Well tested components
->Time saving



Components of STL
->Containers
    It is an object to store data.
    It uses template classes

    For eg: vector,set, map, stack,etc

    Types:
    =>Sequence Containers
        Store data in Linear Fashion

        Eg:Vector, List, Dequeue,etc

        ~>Vector    
            Random Access fast
            Middle Insertion/Deletion is fast
            End Insertion/Deletion is fast

        ~>List
            Random Access is slow
            Middle Insertion/Deletion is fast as compared to array
            End Insertion/Deletion is fast
 
    =>Associative containers
        Direct access to data

        Eg:Set/Multiset, Map/Mulitmap, etc

        All operations are fast except random access.

    =>Derived Containers
        It provide better real world modelling

        Eg:Stack, Queue, Priority-queue,etc


->Algorithms
    It is set of procedure use to manipulate data to reach to a particular solution.In short, procedure to process data
    It uses template functions

    For eg: Searching Algorihthm, Sorting Algorithm,etc


->Iterators
    It is an object points to an element in a containers
    It is like pointer but is a object and handle just like pointer.
    It connnect algorithm with containers
