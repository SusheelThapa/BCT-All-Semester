EXPLANATION OF "Hello_World.cpp"

#include <iostream>

--> There is a file name "iostream "in your computer that is needed to run the program so it will import that files from the computer.


int main()

--> "int" mean integer.
--> "main" is the entry point of execution of program.
--> () is used to say that it is funtion. And here, main is entry point function. 


{
--> Inside {} we write C++ statement.


    std::cout << "Hello World";

    --> std is standard namespace
    --> :: is scope resolution operator
    --> cout is a function that is in 'iostream' which we have included in first line
    --> Above line tells computer to print "Hello World" on the computer screen.
    --> ; tells that our C++ statement has completed.


    return 0;

    --> Before main we have use int, so when all statement of main has completed then it should return some int value. In this case, we have return 0 as int value.
