Pointer:
It is a data type which holds the address of other data types
    For eg:
        int a = 9;

        Let a be store in address "9823"

        Let pointer variable be b:
        The b will store the value 9823 which is address of a(integer variable)
    

Declaration of Pointer: 
    data_type * variable_name ;
    variable_name = address of variable
    
    Eg:

        int a =6;
        int * b;
        b = &a;
