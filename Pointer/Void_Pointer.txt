~A void pointer is pointer that has no data type associated with it 
~A void pointer can be easily typecasted to any pointer type
~In simple language it is general purpose pointer variable

Example:
    int x = 10;
    char y = 'x';

    void *p = &x; //void pointer stores the address of the int 'x'
    p = &y; //void pointer stores the address of the char 'y'

~In dynamic memory allocation, malloc() and calloc() return (void*) type pointer
~This allows these dynamic memory functions to be used to allocate memory of any data type. This is becouse these pointer can be typecasted to any pointer type

~It is not possible to dereference void pointer.
~Ponter arithmetic is not allowed with void pointers.(Some compiler may works but it is not recommanded)
