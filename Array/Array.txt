Array
An array is collection of items of similar types stored in contigous memory locations.



Why Array?
Sometimes, a simple variable is not enough to hold all the data.

For example,

    we want to store the marks of 2500 student haveing 2500 different variable for this task will not be feasible
    
    To solve this problem, we can define an array with size 2500 that can hold the marks of all students.
