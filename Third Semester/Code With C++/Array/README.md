# Array

An array is collection of items of similar types stored in contigious memory locations.

Why Array?

Sometimes, a simple variable is not enough to hold all the data.

For example, 

We want to store the marks of 2500 students having 2500 different variable for this task will not be feasible

To solve this problem, we can define an array with size 2500 that can hold the marks of all students.

## Syntax

    data_type array_name[size];

Example:

    int array[4];

    int array[size]; //When size is taked as input from user.

```

## Initialize Array

    int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5};

```

```C++
Method Two:

    int arr[3];
    arr[0] = 1;
    arr[1] = 2;
