VARIABLE
-->Container to store data

    Just like we use jar to store water, drum for rice, etc. Same like that we have different variable(container) to store different types of data.



TYPES OF VARIABLE
    ->int:: To store integer
    ->float:: To store decimal point number
    ->char:: To store a charcter
    ->double:: To store decimal point number with larger number after decimal
    ->boolean:: To store either True or False


On the basis of scope of variable, 
    Local Variable
        These are declared inside the braces of any function and can be accessed only gfrom there
    Global Variable
        These are declared outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere

Note: Both global and local variable can have same name.But local variable will have preccedance over global variable.



SYNTAX FOR DECLARING VARIABLE

    int a = 4,v=7;
