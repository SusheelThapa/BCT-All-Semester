INHERITANCE IN C++

->Concept of reusbility in C++ is supported by inheritance.

->We can reuse the properties of an existing class

->The existing class is called as the base class

->The new class which is inherited is called as the Derived class

->Reusing classes saves time and money

->There are different types of inheritance in C++


TYPES OF INHERITANCE
->Single inheritance
    A derived class with only one Base class

->Multiple inheritance
    A derived class with more than one Base class

->Hierarchical inheritance
    Several derived class from single class

->Multilevel inheritance
    Deriving a class from already derived class

->Hybrid inheritance
    A combination of multiple inheritance and mulitlevel inheritance
    A class is derived from two clases as in multiple inheritance 
    However, one of the parent classesis not base class
