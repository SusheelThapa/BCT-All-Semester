OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING(OOPS)
->Works on the concept of classes and objects
->A class is a template to create objects
->Treats data as a critical element
->Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects



WHY OOPS?
->C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented features to C language.
->As the size of program increase, readability, maintainability and bug-free nature of program decrease.
->This was the problem with language like C which relied upon functions or procedure
->As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem in an effective manner as high
->Also, as data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised
->Using classes solves this problem by modeling program as real world scenario



TERMS IN OOPS
Class: Basics template for creating objects.

Objects: Basic run time entities

Data Abstraction & Encapsulation: Wrapping data and functions into single unit

Inheritance: Properties of one class can be inherited into others

Polymorphism: ability to take more than one forms.

Dynamic Binding: code which will execute is not known until the program runs

Message Passing: Object.messsage(Information) call format

ADVANTAGE OF OOPS
->Code readability.

->Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.

->Multiple object can co-exist without any interference.

->Software complexity can be easily managed.
